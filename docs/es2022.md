## 版本介绍

`ECMAScript 2022`, the `13th` edition, introduced `top-level await`, allowing the keyword to be used at the top level of modules; new class elements: `public and private instance fields`, `public and private static fields`, private instance methods and accessors, and private static methods and accessors; static blocks inside classes, to perform per-class evaluation initialization; the `#x` in obj syntax, to test for presence of private fields on objects; regular expression match indices via the `/d` flag, which provides start and end indices for matched substrings; the cause property on Error objects, which can be used to record a causation chain in errors; the `at` method for Strings, Arrays, and TypedArrays, which allows relative indexing; and `Object.hasOwn`, a convenient alternative to `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty`.

## 版本介绍

This specification, the 11th edition, introduces the `matchAll` method for Strings, to produce an iterator for all match objects generated by a global regular expression; `import()`, a syntax to asynchronously import Modules with a dynamic specifier; `BigInt`, a new number primitive for working with arbitrary precision integers; `Promise.allSettled`, a new Promise combinator that does not short-circuit; `globalThis`, a universal way to access the global this value; dedicated export \* as ns from 'module' syntax for use within modules; increased standardization of for-in enumeration order; `import.meta`, a host-populated object available in Modules that may contain contextual information about the Module; as well as adding two new syntax features to improve working with “nullish” values (null or undefined): nullish coalescing, a value selection operator; and optional chaining, a property access and function invocation operator that short-circuits if the value to access/invoke is nullish.

`ECMAScript 2023`, the `14th` edition, introduced the `toSorted`, `toReversed`, `with`, `findLast`, and `findLastIndex` methods on `Array.prototype` and `TypedArray.prototype`, as well as the `toSpliced` method on `Array.prototype`; added support for `#!` comments at the beginning of files to better facilitate executable ECMAScript files; and allowed the use of most Symbols as keys in weak collections.

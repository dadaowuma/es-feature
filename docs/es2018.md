This specification, the 9th edition, introduces support for asynchronous iteration via the AsyncIterator protocol and async generators. This specification also includes four new regular expression features: `the dotAll flag`, `named capture groups`, `Unicode property escapes`, and `look-behind assertions`. It also includes `rest parameter` and `spread operator` support for object properties. There have also been many minor updates, editorial and normative, with many contributions from our awesome community.
